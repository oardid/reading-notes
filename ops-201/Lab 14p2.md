# Psychological Safety
## What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?
* Shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking
* A sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up
* Describes a team climate characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves
## Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.
In a warehouse, there were often issues with products, such as receiving the wrong item or incorrect dimensions. When a product is scanned and appears as a different item, it indicates an issue on the receiving side. To address these issues, a team is assigned to investigate and correct them. As a team, we split the work: one person investigates the issues, another corrects them, and the last person stocks the product. To resolve specific issues, we investigate who received the product and inform our leads and managers if someone is consistently assigning items to the wrong products, ensuring they haven't made similar errors to other items.
