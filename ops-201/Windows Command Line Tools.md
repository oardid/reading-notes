# Windows Command Line Tools
## How can you list the files in the current directory using the command prompt?
Typing dir command
## How might the “sfc” command and the “gpupdate” command help in troubleshooting on Windows?
Sfc scans all files, locate any that may be damaged, and repair any of those damaged files. Gpudate forces a particular set of updates on a computer. 
## What advantages does the “robocopy” command offer over the “xcopy” command, and why is it useful for file transfers in certain situations?
robocopy is a better version of xcopy. Robocopy has a number of unique features, the ability to resume a file transfer if it happens to be interrupted anywhere in the middle. This can be good for wide area network or non-terrestrial links, where you may have intermittent connectivity.
## Think about any real-life scenarios from your cultural context where the use of command line tools could be beneficial. Describe one such scenario and explain how a specific command line tool would help address the situation.
If you trying to file a specific type of file and you can't find it inside the graphical interface. The command line would be better in order to find that file. On my startup apps page there was a unknown file. I was trying to open the file location but I couldn't. So I had to go to the terminal in order find where that file was and see what type of file it was.
