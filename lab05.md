# Readings: Installing Virtualbox with Linux Terminal Class Notes 05
### Explain the terms “shell”, “terminal”, “cli”, and “command prompt”. Why are these still used today, when we have graphical interfaces?
Shell, terminal, cli, and command prompt are different ways of asking you to open a terminal to get to a shell. The speed and efficiency is one reason why text interface is still widely used today.
### What are the commands to change directories, list the file’s contents and rename/move files?
The command to change directories is "cd" (change directory). The command for list file's contents and rename/move files is "pwd" (print working directory). 
### What are relative and absolute paths? What is special about starting with a ~ (tilde) or a ‘/’ character in the path?
Relative paths is your current working directory. Absolute paths are any paths that starts with a foward slash to switch the root directory. Starting with ~ (tilde) at the start of your path similarly means "starting from my home directory". Starting with "/" at the start of your path mean "starting from the root directory".
### Explain what Linux is, using anything except English.
