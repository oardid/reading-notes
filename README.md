These reading notes, specifically designed for my cybersecurity course, involve in-depth exploration of articles related to various topics. By carefully analyzing each piece, I aim to grasp the author’s arguments, insights, and perspectives. These notes go beyond mere summaries—they serve as thoughtful reflections and analyses, responding to thought-provoking questions posed by the text. Through this process, I enhance my understanding of complex theories, dissect current events, and engage with philosophical dilemmas.

In simpler terms, these notes help me learn new cybersecurity topics by diving deep into articles and answering critical questions.
