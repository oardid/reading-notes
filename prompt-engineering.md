What's the spacing required to build a wall?
ChatGPT
The spacing required to build a wall depends on various factors such as the type of wall, materials used, and the purpose of the wall. In general, for a typical interior stud wall, the studs are spaced either 16 inches or 24 inches apart (measured from the center of one stud to the center of the next). This spacing provides structural support while maximizing material efficiency.

For exterior walls or walls supporting heavy loads, closer spacing may be necessary to ensure adequate strength and stability. Additionally, specific building codes and regulations may dictate minimum spacing requirements based on factors such as wall height and the type of construction.

It's essential to consult local building codes and regulations and follow best practices to determine the appropriate spacing for your wall construction project.
