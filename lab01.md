# *China's Spy Chip Class 01 Notes*

## How is a hardware hack differnet than a software hack?
Hardware hacks are more difficult to pull off and potentially more devastating, promising the kind of long-term, stealth access that spy agenices are willing to invest millions of dollars and many years to get.
