# ***[Computer Network - AAA (Authentication, Authorization and Accounting)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-network-aaa-authentication-authorization-and-accounting/)***
### Explain each of the three Aâ€™s as you would to a non-technical family member. Use an analogy or a story.
1. Authertication ~ is like a secret handshake that only trusted members know
2. Authorization ~ Getting permission for different things once you proven you a trusted member
3. Accounting ~ If something goes missing, they can check who was there and when it disappeared
### What should the administrator do if the ACS server fails to authenticate a user during AAA implementation?
The administrator should mention using the local database of the device as a backup, in the method list, to implement AAA.
### What is the role of the NAS in the AAA implementation using an ACS server? Use a diagram.
The client or Network Access Server (NAS) sends authentication requests to the ACS server and the server takes the decision to allow the user to access the network resource or not according to the credentials provided by the user. 
# ***[RADIUS Concepts](https://archive.is/27Y19)***
### What are the benefits of using RADIUS for authentication and authorization?
A central database provides better security, enabling a company to set up a policy that can be applied at a single administered network point
### What is RADIUS and what does it stand for?
RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) is a client-server protocol and software that enables remote access servers to communicate with a central server to authenticate dial-in users and authorize their access to the requested system or service.
### Research: What encryption algorithms does RADIUS use?
NAS. The NAS queries the authentication server to get authentication, authorization and configuration information about the remote user.
