# ***[What is a Virtual Private Cloud(VPC)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cloud/what-is-a-virtual-private-cloud/)***
### How can one host within a VPC any services that need to be public?
A VPC isolates computing resources from the other computing resources available in the public cloud. The key technologies for isolating a VPC from the rest of the public cloud are: Subnets, VLAN and VPN
### What are examples of services that would live in the publicly-accessible part of the VPC? The privately-accessible part?
Public cloud service providers include AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure, among others. A private cloud is a cloud service that is exclusively offered to one organization.
### What are the trade-offs of using a VPC vs traditional infrastructure?
* Scalability: A VPC is hosted by a public cloud provider, customers can add more computing resources on demand.
* Easy hybrid cloud deployment: Relatively simple to connect a VPC to a public cloud or to on-premises infrastructure via the VPN.
* Better performance: Cloud-hosted websites and applications typically perform better than those hosted on local on-premises servers.
* Better security: The public cloud providers that offer VPCs often have more resources for updating and maintaining the infrastructure, especially for small and mid-market businesses. For large enterprises or any companies that face extremely tight data security regulations, this is less of an advantage.
