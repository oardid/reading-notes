## ***[CIDR Block Notation Explained in 2 Minutes](https://medium.com/@ethicalentrepreneur/cidr-block-notation-explained-in-2-minutes-1010ec0dbc15)***
### What is CIDR notation? a CIDR block?
CIDR notation is a way of representing a CIDR block, which is simply a range of IP addresses. When you create a network, the aim is to make sure there are enough available IP addresses for your use case, without making the CIDR block too large and wasteful.
### How many octets are found in an IPv4 address?
Four 8-bit decimal numbers or octets sperarated by dots
### Setting binary aside and using the decimal system, what is the range of numbers found in an octet?
A range of 0-255
### What does the final digit after the “/” represent in an IPv4 address?
It represents how many bit make up the mask.
### How many IP addresses are in the CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24?
It will give us a range of 10.0.0.0-10.0.0.255, which is just 256 (or 2⁸) IP adresses
## ***[What Is Network Segmentation and Why It Matters?](https://www.comptia.org/blog/security-awareness-training-network-segmentation)***
### In your own words, describe network segmentation.
Networks spearated by firewalls, switches and routers
### Network segmentation isn’t important as long as the network is using a well configured firewall. Do you agree? Why or why not?
Network segmentation is important because it protects your asstes more effectively 
### What is a screened subnet?
Subnetworks that expose externally facing systems - where the handshakes take place on your network.
### Cameras, ID card scanners, locked doors and biometrics are just a few examples of what type of security?
Traditional physical security
