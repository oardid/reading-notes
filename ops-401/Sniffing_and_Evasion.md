## [What is a Sniffing Attack in System Hacking?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-sniffing-attack-in-system-hacking/)

### Explain a Sniffing attack using non-technical terms.
Imagine you're at a coffee shop, and someone is secretly listening to your conversation. They're not saying anything, but they're hearing everything you're discussing. This is similar to a sniffing attack. In a sniffing attack, someone is secretly capturing and analyzing the information being sent over a network, like emails, passwords, or credit card numbers. This can be done using special software or hardware that can "listen" to the network traffic.
### What are the two types of sniffing attacks and what are some pros and cons of each approach?
* **ARP Spoofing:** This involves sending forged ARP messages to associate a victim's IP address with a different MAC address, allowing the attacker to hijack sessions or cause denial-of-service attacks.
  * Pros: Can be difficult to detect, allows for greater control over network traffic.
  * Cons: Requires advanced technical skills, and can be detected with proper security measures.
* **Sniffing:** This involves sniffing or capturing packets on the network, and then either sending them repeatedly to a victim machine or replaying them back to the sender with modifications.
  * Pros: Can be easier to execute, and can provide valuable information about network traffic patterns.
  * Cons: May not provide as much control over network traffic, and can be detected with proper security measures.
### How does encryption protect traffic against sniffing attacks?
When data is encrypted, it's scrambled, making it difficult for anyone who intercepts it to read or understand its contents. Encryption ensures that only authorized parties with the correct decryption key can access the data, making it much harder for attackers to use sniffing attacks.
