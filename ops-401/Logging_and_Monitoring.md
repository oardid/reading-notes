### Explain CloudWatch Events to a non-technical friend.
Like a dashboard, light alerts you to issues with your car, CloudWatch keeps a watchful eye on your AWS resources. Itâ€™s like having a companion that notifies you when something important happens in your cloud environment.
### What do CloudWatch Logs help us achieve?
It helps us achieve access, monitor & store access log files from AWS resources like EC2, Lambda functions, CloudTrail, Route 53, and other sources.
### What capabilities does CloudWatch Anomaly detection have?
CloudWatch Anomaly Detection has several capabilities. It can learn and model the expected behavior of a metric based on prior data. It can also calculate expected values and generate an Anomaly Detection band based on a lower and an upper band metric. Metric values that fall outside the predicted confidence band are considered anomalies. CloudWatch Anomaly Detection also enables you to create alarms based on the Anomaly Detection band and remediate detected anomalies. Finally, it supports AWS API and CloudFormation.
