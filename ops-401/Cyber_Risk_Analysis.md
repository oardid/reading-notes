### Consider a bank ATM that allows users to access bank account balances. What measures can the ATM incorporate to cover the principles of the CIA triad?
* Confidentiality: Implement user autherntication mechanisms such as PINS, biometric, or two-factor authentication.
* Integrity: Log all transactions and interaction with the ATM, record all activities.
* Availability: Constantly monitor the health of the ATM system
### Name three best practices that support the CIA triad.
* Least privilege: Allowing users to have only the required access to do their jobs.
* Need to know: In addition to clearance, users must also have a “need to know” to access classified data.
* Dual control: Requiring more than one user to perform a task.

### What are the three stages of the risk management lifecycle? What is each stage’s main goal or objective?
* Risk assessment: Categorize, classify and evaluate assets, as well as identify threats and vulnerabilities
* Risk analysis: Both qualitative and quantitative
* Risk mitigation/response: Includes reducing or avoiding risk, transferring risk, and accepting or rejecting risk
