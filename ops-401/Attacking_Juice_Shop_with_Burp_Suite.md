## [What is Burp Suite?](https://www.technipages.com/what-is-burp-suite/)

### Explain how Burp Suite allows us to analyze web application traffic.
The proxy can intercept web requests and responses and read and edit them in real time before they reach their respective destinations
### What does the Repeater tool allow us to do with requests?
Repeater allows you to import a web request and then make manual modifications to it and see the response side by side allowing you to make minor adjustments to attempted exploits and easily see if itâ€™s working. 
### Why might this be a useful tool for an attacker?
Once a vulnerability is identified, Repeater can be used to exploit it by sending carefully crafted requests that trigger the vulnerability.
