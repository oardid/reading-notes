While this is a technology course, success with the deluge of work within depends heavily on the mindset that you bring to the table.

With that in mind, this is some prework to get us all on the same page about dealing with difficulty in our lives.

We could all use mindset reminders.

* Watch Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset. (10 minutes)
* Watch Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit. (6 minutes)
* Watch Alain de Botton on Redefining Success. (17 minutes)
* Assess your emotional intelligence. If you have done it in the past, now you can identify the areas you have grown in recently.
* Assess your biases. If you have done it in the past, now you can identify the areas you have grown in recently.
