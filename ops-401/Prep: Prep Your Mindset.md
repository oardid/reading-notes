While this is a technology course, success with the deluge of work within depends heavily on the mindset that you bring to the table.

With that in mind, this is some prework to get us all on the same page about dealing with difficulty in our lives.

**Note**: If you’ve already watched/read/listened to the below before, just take some time and revisit them.

We could all use mindset reminders.
