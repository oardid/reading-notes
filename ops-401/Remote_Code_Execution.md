### You just got a new job as a Cyber Threat Analyst, how would you explain your role to a family member?
Imagine our house has valuable things, and we want to keep it safe from burglars. You’d put locks on the doors, set up an alarm, put bars on the windows, and cameras to watch for intruders. But you also need someone to keep an eye on everything and know what to do if someone tries to break in. That’s what I do for a company’s digital information.

### Explain what makes PowerShell such an effective attack vector.
PowerShell is an ideal channel for delivering these attacks because of its wide deployment and access to all parts of a host via the .NET framework. Additionally, it is easy to develop scripts applicable for payload delivery, and because PowerShell is a trusted application, it will almost always be allowed to execute scripts with impunity.

### What are two things you can do to mitigate attacks that leverage PowerShell?
- Logging and monitoring
- Execution permissions
