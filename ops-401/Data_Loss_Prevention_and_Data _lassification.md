## [What is Data Loss Prevention (DLP)?](https://www.digitalguardian.com/blog/what-data-loss-prevention-dlp-definition-data-loss-prevention)

### How would you convince your organization about the importance of implementing a DLP solution?
Data Loss Prevention prevents unauthorized access, misuse, and loss of sensitive data. 
### How would you explain the three main use cases for DLP to friends or family?
Personal Information Protection and Compliance is like to posting a story on Instagram, where you have the ability to choose who sees your story. DLP (Data Loss Prevention) helps set up those privacy settings for you.

Intellectual Property (IP) Protection is similar to creating a product and having a trademark on that product. The IP ensures that no one can steal your product or claim it as their own.

Data visibility is like a magical telescope that shows you what's happening with your information. DLP gives you superpowers to monitor emails, files, and messages, and brings hidden data to light, allowing you to have a clear view of what's going on with your information.
