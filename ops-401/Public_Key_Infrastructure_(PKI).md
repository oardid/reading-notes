## [What is Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)](https://www.ssh.com/academy/pki)

### Name the three main components which make up PKI.
* Secure Web Sites - HTTPS
* Authenticating Users and Computers - SSH
* Email Signing and Encryption
### How would you explain, to a non-technical friend, the role PKI plays in protecting traffic between your browser and a web server.
PKI is an encryption system that uses two keys: public and private. The public key is used to lock the message, while the private key is used to unlock it. The system also involves certificates issued by trusted authorities to verify website identity.
### What is the main weakness of the PKI architecture?
Any certificate authority can sign a certificate for any person or computer.
