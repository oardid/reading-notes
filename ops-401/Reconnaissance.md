## [What is penetration testing](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/penetration-testing/)

### How are the stages of a pen test very similar to those of the Cyber Kill Chain?
Similarities between Penetration Test Stages and Cyber Kill Chain:
* Reconnaissance (Identify, Reconnaissance): Both pen tests and the Cyber Kill Chain start with identifying potential targets and gathering information about them.
* Exploitation (Attack): In a pen test, this stage involves exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access to the target system. In the Cyber Kill Chain, it's the "Attack" stage, where an attacker gains initial access to the system.
* Lateral Movement (Advancement): In a pen test, this stage involves escalating privileges and moving laterally within the network to gain further access. In the Cyber Kill Chain, it's the "Command and Control" stage, where the attacker establishes a foothold in the network.
* Installation (Persistence): In a pen test, this stage involves installing backdoors or malware to maintain access to the system. In the Cyber Kill Chain, it's the "Establish Command and Control" stage, where the attacker establishes a persistent presence on the system.
* Action (Impact): In a pen test, this stage involves achieving the desired outcome, such as gaining access to sensitive data or disrupting business operations. In the Cyber Kill Chain, it's the "Action" stage, where the attacker achieves their intended goal.
### Your manager has asked you to explain the benefits of a pentest to the companyâ€™s leadership. How would you lead this conversation?
A penetration test is a proactive measure that simulates an attack on our systems and networks to identify vulnerabilities before malicious actors do. This allows us to avoid potential threats and improve our overall security posture. We can identify vulnerabilities before they're exploited through a pen test, improve our incident response planning and preparedness, and enhance our security controls. Additionally, we'll receive actionable recommendations for remediation and can take cost-effective measures to mitigate potential risks.
