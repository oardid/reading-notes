### You just started a new job as a Malware Analyst. Explain your job responsibilities to a family member.
As a Malware Analyst, my job involves studying malicious software (malware) to understand how it works, how it spreads, and what it does to infected systems.
### What are the six steps of the Malware Analysis process? Whatâ€™s a good mnemonic you can use to remember it?
* Step 1: Capture the malware.
* Step 2: Build a malware lab.
* Step 3: Install your tools.
* Step 4: Record the baseline.
* Step 5: Commence your investigation.
* Step 6: Document the results.
* A good mnemonic to remember these steps is C.A.C.R.M.M.: "Cats Always Chase Rats, Mice, & More."
### You are tasked with analyzing a new malware sample. Which type of malware analysis would you conduct first and why?
When tasked with analyzing a new malware sample, I would start with Static Analysis. Starting with static analysis allows for a safer and more structured approach to understanding the new malware sample before moving on to more complex and potentially risky dynamic analysis.
