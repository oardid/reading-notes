### How are Threat Hunting and Pentesting different?
Threat Hunting identifies and analyzes potential threats within an organization's IT infrastructure. The goal is to detect and disrupt unknown or emerging threats.
Pentesting is a simulated attack on an organization's computer system to assess its security vulnerabilities with permission from the organization. The goal is to identify system, network, and application weaknesses.
### What is the primary objective of Threat Hunting?
The primary objective of Threat Hunting is to identify and mitigate unknown or zero-day threats that may have evaded detection by traditional security controls. Threat Hunting aims to detect and respond to potential threats before they cause harm.
