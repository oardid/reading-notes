### What is the main goal of Threat Hunting and how is it different from traditional threat monitoring?
The goal of threat hunting is to detect and mitigate threats as early as possible in the attack life cycle before they can do significant damage. Threat hunting is different from traditional threat monitoring in that it is proactive rather than reactive.
### What are the four types of YARA rules and what does each one of them use to identify and classify malicious software?
* String-based rules: These rules use strings of text, either as literal values or as regular expressions, to identify malware. For example, you might use a string-based rule to detect malware that contains a specific string of characters in its code.
* File metadata-based rules: These rules use metadata about the files being analyzed to identify malware. For example, you might use a file metadata-based rule to detect a particular file type or to identify files that have been created or modified within a specific time period.
* Hash-based rules: These rules use cryptographic hashes to identify malware. A cryptographic hash is a unique representation of the contents of a file, and if any part of the file changes, the hash will also change. Hash-based rules can be used to detect malware that has been modified or disguised in an attempt to evade detection.
* Network-based rules: These rules use network traffic data, such as IP addresses or ports, to identify malware. For example, you might use a network-based rule to detect malware that is communicating with a specific IP address or port.
### How are YARA rules similar to how Anti-Virus programs detect malicious software?
Both YARA rules and antivirus programs employ pattern matching and signature-based detection to identify malicious software

* [YARA Rules GitHub Project](https://github.com/Yara-Rules/rules)
  <h5> * This project covers the need of a group of IT Security Researchers to have a single repository where different Yara signatures are compiled, classified and kept as up to date as possible, and began as an open source community for collecting Yara rules. </h5>
