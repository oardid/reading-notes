## [What is Computer Forensics?](https://www.wgu.edu/blog/computer-forensics2004.html)

### What are the main differences between computer forensics and cybersecurity?
Cybersecurity primarily focuses on preventing and mitigating cybercrime by optimizing an organization’s security protocols. By contrast, computer forensic professionals concentrate on extracting files, data, or information from digital devices, cloud platforms, or wireless networks.
### What are the six stages of a computer forensics examination?
* Forensic computer analyst. This profession lies at the intersection of criminology and computer science. Computer analysts’ data collection and analysis efforts often directly impact the outcome of criminal and civil legal cases. 
* Digital forensic investigator. Digital forensic investigators are digital detectives who gather evidence from devices and systems, present expert testimony in court, and actively fight against cybercrime. 
* Computer forensics technician. Technicians perform hands-on analysis of electronic devices, networks, and cloud platforms. They often work in tandem with cybersecurity teams and law enforcement. 
* Information security analyst. Information security analysts protect organizations against cyberattacks and other security incidents by installing firewalls and other security measures, simulating cyberattacks to test the strength of the security system, and training staff on how to identify and prevent cybercrime. 
* Network security engineer. Network security engineers design and manage network security systems. They test networks to identify vulnerabilities and continuously optimize defensive protocols to reduce the risk of a successful cyberattack. 
* Security consultant. Organizations hire security consultants to assess and improve their systems. Consultants often work closely with IT departments and managers to ensure that everyone understands their role in protecting sensitive information.
