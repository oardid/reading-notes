### Explain threat modeling using real-world non-technical examples.
Imagine you're planning a big party with your friends. You want to make sure everything goes smoothly and everyone has a great time. You start by thinking about the potential issues that could arise during the party: What if someone gets too drunk and breaks something? We can identify potential threats that would occur in our party. We can think about ways to mitigate these threats: by setting up a "spill station" with cleaning supplies and a plan for quick cleanup. 
### What are the four questions that can help us organize threat modeling?
What are we working on?
What can go wrong?
What are we going to do about it?
Did we do a good job?
### You are the project lead for a new application. How would you explain the benefits of Threat Modeling to the rest of the team?
Threat Modeling is a systematic approach to identify, analyze, and prioritize potential security threats to our application. It's a proactive process that helps us understand the attack surface of our system and identify vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.
