## [IBM Cloud Learn Hub - What is a Virtual Private Cloud?](https://www.ibm.com/topics/vpc)

### What are some of the key features of the VPC model?
* **Agility**, lets you control the size of your virtual network and deploy cloud resources as needed. You can scale these resources dynamically in real-time.
* **Availability**, Redundant resources, and highly fault-tolerant availability zone architectures mean that your applications and workloads are highly available.
* **Security**, Because the VPC is a logically isolated network, your data and applications won’t share space or mix with those of the cloud provider’s other customers. You have full control over how resources and workloads are accessed, and by whom.
* **Affordability**, VPC customers can take advantage of the public cloud’s cost-effectiveness, such as saving on hardware costs, labor times, and other resources.
### What are the three tiers that comprise the three-tier architecture model?
* **Web or presentation tier**, which takes requests from web browsers and presents information that is created by, or stored within, the other layers to end users.
* **Application tier**, which houses the business logic and is where most processing takes place.
* **Database tier**, composed of database servers that store the data that is processed in the application tier.
### Describe the differences between a VPC and a VPN to someone you know from your previous job.
VPC allows you to create private networks in the cloud. VPN allows you to create remote connections between networks.
