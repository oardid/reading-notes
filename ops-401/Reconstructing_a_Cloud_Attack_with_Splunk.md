### What are the benefits of a forward proxy?
A forward proxy can get around institutional or state browsing restrictions, prevent access to specific content, or safeguard your identity online.
### Explain the differences between a forward and a reverse proxy?
A forward proxy is a server that sits in front of a client and ensures that no origin server ever communicates directly with that specific client. On the other hand, a reverse proxy sits in front of an origin server and ensures that no client ever communicates directly with that origin server.
### Explain to your manager why your organization might benefit from implementing a reverse proxy?
Implementing a reverse proxy will prevent attacks, handle incoming traffic (load balancing), and encrypt and decrypt SSL or TLS for each client.
