## [The Pros and Cons of Network Intrusion Detection Systems]()

### List 2 differences between firewalls and an IDS?
Firewalls control network traffic by managing inbound and outbound traffic, IP addresses, ports, and protocols. An intrusion detection system (IDS) analyzes network traffic and system logs.
### Under what circumstances would you choose a network-based IDS over a host-based IDS?
You would choose a network-based IDS when you need to monitor traffic across the network. You would choose a host-based IDS when you need to monitor events and audit logs and compare new entries to known attack signatures.
### Name 3 major drawbacks of a NIDS?
IP Packets can still be faked, false positives are frequent, and susceptible to protocol-based attacks
