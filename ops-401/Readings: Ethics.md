<h3>Articles that I choose:</h3>
1. <b>The code I'm still ashamed of:</b> The development of self-driving cars presents complex ethical dilemmas, particularly in "no-win" situations where the car must make difficult choices that may harm someone. There is no clear guidance on how to address these dilemmas, leaving policymakers, regulators, and industry professionals to navigate the challenges and make decisions that align with human values and ethics.<br>
2. <b>Self-Driving Car Ethics:</b> A software developer, Bill Sourour, shares his experience working on a project that promoted a drug linked to depression and suicidal thoughts. At 21, he built a website that recommended the drug to teenage girls based on a quiz. He didn't think twice about it at the time but later learned about a young girl who took the drug and committed suicide. The article highlights the importance of ethics in software development and how code can impact people's lives. Bill now prioritizes considering ethical implications before writing code and encourages developers to take a stand and ensure ethics are present in their work.
