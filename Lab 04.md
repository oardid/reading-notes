## Troubleshooting Techniques
## What should you do if multiple issues are happening simultaneously during troubleshooting?
Break those up into individual problems and then go through this same troubleshooting process with each one of those individually.
## What should be done once a successful solution has been identified during the troubleshooting process?
Time to implement the solution
## What are the benefits of documenting the entire troubleshooting process in a knowledge base?
Always document the troubleshooting process. You will never know when the same issue will pop up again. If say issue does arise you can do back to your troubleshooting process and see the solution that fix that problem.
## Think about a technological device particularly popular in your culture or community. Imagine a scenario where issues arise: how would you apply CompTIA A+ troubleshooting methodology to help, while considering the end-userâ€™s cultural background?
